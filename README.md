# Learn-C
Lessons on the C programming language.

## What is C?
C is a *low-level programming language* created in 1972 at Bell Labs. It is known for its speed and efficient memory. C is a **procedural language**, which means it doesn't have support for objects, like it's extension **C++**.

## Why Should You Learn C?
C is still widely used given it was made almost 40 years ago. Many applications and games use C, for example:
* Mario (uses C and C++)
* Doom
* Python (written in C)

## Why *Shouldn't* You Learn C?
C is, as I said before, a low-level programming language. This means, programs will require more code than in other languages like Python and JavaScript. Here's a comparision between C and Python:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("This is written in C!");
    return 0;
}
```

```Python
print("This is written in Python!");
```

That being said, it is still a very fast language since it is *compiled*, which means that it is translated into the devices native language. Some languages, like Python, don't compile code. Instead, they run it in a *virtual machine* which tends to be slower.
